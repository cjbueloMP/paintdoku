## Paintdoku
Paintdoku is a puzzle solved similarly to a sudoku, but instead of writing numbers to complete squares/lines, you fill in squares to create a picture. The numbers to the side and above each row/column show the number of consecutive squares that must be filled in, with space between that group and the next group and that row/column. Create your own with this script to solve.
